# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Package Summary
This script uses `tweepy` to interact with the Twitter API and fetch tweets containing a specific hashtag. It then employs `nltk` and its VADER Sentiment Analyzer to evaluate the sentiment of each tweet.

## Install and Run Instructions
1. Install the required packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Fill in your Twitter API credentials in the script.
3. Run the script:
python tweet_sentiment_analyzer.py

## Code Explanation
- The script starts by importing necessary libraries and downloading the VADER lexicon.
- `analyze_tweets` is a function that fetches tweets and analyzes their sentiment (see line numbers 8-35).
- The Twitter authentication setup is on lines 18-21.
- Tweets are fetched and analyzed in a loop from lines 23-35.

## Future Idea
For a final project, this script could be expanded into a comprehensive tool for monitoring social media sentiment, capable of tracking changes over time, identifying trending topics, and alerting on significant shifts in public opinion or emerging crises.

Replace VERSION with the latest versions of the libraries you're using. To generate this file accurately, you can set up a virtual environment, install the packages, and then use pip freeze > requirements.txt.
